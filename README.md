# Introduction

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. This popularity come from very good documentation, security, and cross-platform ability. Java can be used to various kind of software engineering, start from desktop application, website application, mobile application, and so much more. In this section we will deep dive in our powerful Java technology, start from know why Java so important and how we can start learn about this popular technology.

### What Is Java?

Java is high level programming language which first developed by **Sun Microsystems** at 1991. One of best feature which Java have is ability to work in various kind of software platform and operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc without effort to change main source code.

One of many privilege that Java have is **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine). It means that Java source code will compiled into bytecode format and can be run in cross platform using fit JVM. JVM have responsibility to interpret bytecode and run it, this make Java became very portable and platform independent.

### Why Java is Important?

Java have an advantages that make it be the popular choice in programming worlds

1.  **Portability**

    It means Java can be run in cross platform
2.  **Security**

    Java have various security layer that which allow developer to create secure and reliable app
3.  **Code Readability**

    Java programming language created which focus at readability code, it makes java much easier to learn and understand for new programmer
4.  **Strong Community**

    Java have very big and active developer community, it means we can have an access to lot of resource, tools, and support
5.  **Company Support**

    Java supported by **Oracle Corporation**, a big technology company that give long term guarantee for this language
